* BUG: When creating a new vme config, then quitting and restarting the program
  the filename shows up as "vme.vme" but any existing file with that name is
  not loaded!
* Sphinx Doc
    - Sphinx and output dependent image types
    - Add GIT_TAG variable and use it in conf.py as the 'version' setting
* Take a look at MVMEContext::runScript() and try to fix it. The stuff that's
  done in stopDAQ() seems to work very well...

* Make MVMEContext::runScript() work like the AnalysisPauser: use a
  QProgressDialog, a local event loop and signals slots to make pausing
  reliable and non-hacky.

* Logspam still makes the app hang! Fix this!!!

* Diagnostics UI: make sigma text way bigger for andi.
  Nice solution could be to use an instant tooltip with a big font size
* HDF5 and Root file writing support!
  Also implement read support for HDF5
* NSIS Installer:
  * Templates are not properly installed by the NSIS installer? (Robert)
  * Integrate into cmake
* Histo1D and Histo1DWidget
    * With a small window height the FreeRate text is clipped by the horizontal
      scrollbar! The offset seems to be relative to the windows height or the
      axis scale or something.
    * Implement Histogram rebinning
    * Histo1D Calibration UI: "Restore" uses unexpected values. Also there's no way to undo the restore operation. (calibResetToFilter)
    * Bug: H1D does not work when unitMin > unitMax
    * Histo1DWidget: zoom out after setHistogram()
      But not when the usage is the one in x- and y-projections where the histo is
      replaced with a similar one.
    * Histo1DWidget: The curve for the last bin is not drawn. Try to finally find a fix for this.
    * Read up on binning error calculations. See how ROOT does it.
    * show fwhm only when gauss display is active

* Analysis and AnalysisUI
    * Analysis UI: selected element highlight is too dark in windows 7. Robert
      can't read the label if it's selected.
    * "Import" only seems to import Filter Extractors. Histograms are missing...
    * Open new histograms immediately. Do this when creating a sub-histogram.
    * Copy/Paste
      - Copy needs a clone() operation for analysis elements.
      - On copying an extractor the edit dialog should be opened.
      - Having the ability to clone operators would allow making editing of
        operators much safer.
        Right now if the user picks another input or clears any input slots the
        analysis has to be paused and restarted and dependent operators
        immediately notice the change. This means even if the user cancels the
        dialog the analysis can have unexpected modifications.
        With cloning a copy of the operator would be created. Selecting and
        clearing inputs would only affect the cloned version of the operator
        (input pipes would not need to be fully connected so the input sources
        do not need to change at all during editing -> half connected state!)

- Add error reporting to VMEConfig and Analysis version conversion and read routines

- Refactor gui_write_json_file() to write_json_file() and use exceptions to report errors.
  Meaning: implement functionality using exceptions and not caring about if
  it's used from the gui or not. Then build and use gui wrappers which show
  messageboxes where needed.

- Add warnings to template loading if there are duplicate module types
- Fix diagnosis window hanging and eating system memory when EOE check is
  active and a lot of errors are occuring

* Clearly document Extractor behaviour:
  - How does it use the individual filters?
  - How are data and address values formed?
  - How does WordIndex behave?
  - What does RequiredCompletionCount do?

* Log throttling!!!!

* Check for off-by-one errors in the 2D projection code

* lastlog.log:
  Write every logged message to lastlog.log. Do this in the main thread. Flush
  to disk frequently.
  At startup move lastlog.log to lastlog.1.log.
  Keep 5 logfiles around. 4 -> 5, 3 -> 4, 2 -> 3, 1 -> 2, 0 -> 1



* select input UI: disable other tree highlights while it's active.
* Fix replay stats display and replay timer. It wasn't designed with pausing
  and stepping in mind.
* ZIP file support:
  On close:
  - write some user description text file to the zip. "Run description", "Run notes", "DAQ notes"
 - save/saveas/load error reporting

==========================
==== Do these later! =====
==========================
* VMEConfig
    * Allow Adding of VME-Init scripts to modules via the gui!

* EventWidget and AnalysisWidget repopulate:
  - Restore open PipeDisplays:
    Store (ObjectId, OutputIndex) to get the output pipe and (pos, size) to restore the widget.
  - Restore splitter states when recreating event widgets.
  - Restore node expansion state
    Could store QUuids for expanded object nodes and after repop rebuild the
    VoidStar set of expanded nodes by getting the pointers via the ids.
* Analysis structure:
  SourceEntry does not really need the eventId as the moduleId implicitly
  specifies the eventId.
* H1D: Take the median of the visible left and right edges. Subtract that value
  from the calculated statistics values. This is supposed to remove the noise
  to the left and right of a peak.
* HistoViewer: Ability to save filled Histograms to disk and reload them later.
  This will allow using histogram tools (fits, etc.) on loaded histos. It also
  allows comparing histos from different runs etc.
* Calculated listfile size in stats display and size shown by windows explorer
  are not the same at all. Why?
* // FIXME: when using subranges the getBinUnchecked() calculation often yields negative bins. why?
  Verify this does in fact happen.
* DAQStats:
  - add pause/resume
  - figure out why buffers/s never has a fractional part
    -> part of the system. addBuffersRead() and addBytesRead() each call maybeUpdateIntervalCounters().
       If we're reading less than 1 buffer per second the resulting bytesPerSecond will be 0 for that interval.
    How to make this better?
- License info needs Apache License for PCG. Maybe others. Check what is needed here!
  Also use info from resources/README
- VMUSB: if there are connect/reconnect errors write them to the log view
  Do this when porting to libusb-1.0 as that should also provide better error messages.
- VMUSB: make the mutex non-recursive!

>>>>> Begin Analysis NG <<<<<
 - Add Operator::getDescription()
 - make sure the UI works with empty vme and event configs
 - display required memory in Histo2D dialog.
 - combine "single word" and "dual word" filters. the distinction is not needed
   anymore as both are MultiWordDataFilters now
 - Load default filters from templates
<<<<< End AnalysisNG >>>>>

* Git version is not updated when rebuilding the project! FIX THIS!
  -> I failed at this. qmake is horrible.

* GUI
  * add versioning to the GUI state saved via QSettings. If the version changes
    use the default layout instead of restoring a possibly incompatible state.
  * add a "reset gui state" button somewhere

* add ability to add notes to VME/analysis config (maybe other objects too)
* VMEScript: add print command
* Limit the number of messages/s appended to the logview. With multithreading:
  do messages fill up one of the threads event queues? Can this be limited
  somehow? Better to directly limit the generation of these messages?
* Fix diagnostics window blocking when there are a lot of error messages being generated.

* Histos:
  * add histogram cuts
  * add histogram fitting

* Mesytec Module Firmware Revision & Hardware ID
* prefix and (maybe) run number for listfiles

* Mesytec Werbung ^^ Hintergrundbilder, Wasserzeichen, etc. (CSS Theme?)
* Hist2d: look for standard color scales as used in publications, ROOT, etc.
  https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/TColor_8cxx_source.html#l02400
* How to handle filters without matching module? Right now they're not
  displayed until a module with the corresponding (eventIndex,moduleIndex) is
  created.
  Related: Remove Hist2d on filter removal?
  => would all be fixed when moving from (eventIndex, moduleIndex) to using object ids.

* threading and vme commands
  * run vme scripts in a separate thread when invoked from the gui

* ReadoutWorker split into generic and controller specific parts:
    Generic part is responsible for:
        - running vme init scripts
        - creating and opening the output listfile

    Controller specific parts:
        - init
        - readout
        - shutdown
        - pause
        - resume
  Do this when implementing support for another controller, not before.

* save and restore the zoom and pan of histograms
* save and restore open histograms

==========================
===== Maybe do these =====
==========================

======================================
==== Done, but kept for reference ====
======================================
>>>>> Begin Analysis NG <<<<<
* Filter on number of occurence: the filter is considered complete only if it
  matched N times.
  Needed for devices that can yield data for the same address in a single
  event. If the filter does not specify an occurence condition but matches
  multiple times only the first matched value will be kept.
  XXX: Impossible to simply accumulate all raw values for a channel into a Hist1D!
  -> Not an issue according to Robert as multi hits per channel need to be
     handled explicitly anyways.
===== Plan to handle array -> single value conversion =====
- Pipes are only used as output of Operators/Sources
- Pipes connect to Slots of Operators
- The slot specifies what kind of inputs it accepts: Array, Value, Both
- When an output pipe is connected to an input slot and the slot accepts Values
  the index into the input parameters must be supplied.
- Slots live in the receiving Operator. They now hold the source Pipe pointers
- The 'destination' member of Pipes now contains pointers to Slot instead of OperatorInterface
- Slots need to contain pointers to their owning Operator to be able to traverse the tree forward:
  sourceOp.outputPipe[i].destinations[j].destOp
