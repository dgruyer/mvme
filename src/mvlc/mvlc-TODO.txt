* Think and document how the timeout setters and getters should behave. For
  usb under linux they become active on the next read/write.
  For sockets they're set in connect() and in the setters if the connection
  has been established.
  -> Try to keep as is: setting the timeouts should keep them and apply them
  when connecting. Setting them while connected should apply the timeouts
  immediately.

* Should the dialog part be called "Session"? Protocol? Request/Response?

* Build a tool to verify incoming readout data. Check headers and pointers. Test this with
  different incoming event sizes.
  For the first pass it's ok to do this offline.

* Low Level MVLC Ethernet Debugging:

    ifconfig enp2s0 192.168.42.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    arp -i enp2s0 -s 192.168.42.2 ab:cd:12:34:56:78

  Start wireshark or tcpdump in a second terminal window
    sudo tcpdump -i enp2s0 -vvXX

  Use netcat to generate an UDP packet containing "Hello, World!" as the payload.
    echo "Hello, world!" | netcat -u 192.168.42.2 9000

  To delete the arp entry:
    arp -i enp2s0 -d 192.168.42.2
