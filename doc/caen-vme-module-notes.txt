CAEN V1190A
===========

In continuous storage a slave TDC can be programmed to keep token until no more data;
otherwise the TDC passes the token; in trigger matching mode each slave must be
programmed in order to keep the token until the end of the event.

A match between a trigger and a hit is detected within a programmable time window.
The trigger matching control on the V1190 is handled through 4 programmable
parameters 3 (see ยง 5.3.1 and ยง 5.3.4):
- match window,
- window offset,
- extra search margin,
- reject margin.

* Multi Event Splitting probably won't work because the Word Count used to split
  a buffer into events is written in a trailing word, not in the first word.
  -> Check how the algorithm actually works

* MicroController communication can take a really long time. Experimenting with
  the TRG_MATCH command (0x00) showed that the WRITE_OK bit takes >= 600ms to
  become high again after issuing the command.

* Using the Control Register 'test_fifo' bit does not seem to work. I wasn't
  able to get any data from the module. Also writing to the Testreg (0x1028)
  didn't have any effect.

* Enable the 'TDC Errors' and 'ETTT' data word0x00002439s.
