User Guide
----------------------------------------

UI Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Analysis system in mvme is designed to allow

* flexible parameter extraction from raw readout data.
* calibration and additional processing of extracted parameters.
* accumulation and visualization of processed data.

The user interface follows the structure of data flow in the system: the
modules for the selected *Event* are shown in the top-left tree.

The bottom-left tree contains the *raw histograms* used to accumulate the
unmodified data extracted from the modules.

The next column (*Level 1*) contains calibration operators in the top view and
calibrated histograms in the bottom view.

    Analysis UI Block Diagram


.. note::
    To get a set of basic data extraction filters, calibration operators and
    histograms right-click on a module an select *Generate default filters*.

User Levels are used to structure the analysis and it's completely optional to have
more than two of them. Additional levels can be added/removed using the *+* and
*-* buttons at the top-right.  Use the *Level Visibility* button to select
which levels are shown/hidden.

The UI enforces the rule that operators can use inputs from levels less-than or
equal to their own level. This means data should always flow from left to
right.

Operators can be moved between levels by dragging and dropping them.


.. _analysis-ui-screenshot:

    Analysis UI Screenshot

    The Calibration for *mdpp16.amplitude*  is selected. Its input is shown in
    green. Operators using the calibrated data are shown in a light blueish
    color.

Selecting an object will highlight its input data sources in green and any
operators using its output in blue.

Adding new objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right-click in any of the views and select *New* to add new operators and
histograms. A dialog will pop up with input fields for operator specific
settings and buttons to select the operators inputs.

Clicking any of the input buttons will make the user interface enter "input
select mode". In this mode valid outputs for the selected input are
highlighted.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_ui_add_op_input_select.png
    :scale-latex: 100%

    Input select mode

    Adding a :ref:`analysis-RangeFilter1D` to Level 2. Valid inputs are
    highlighted in green.

Click an input node to use it for the new operator. If required fill in any
additional operator specific data and accept the dialog. The operator will be
added to the system and will immediately start processing data if a DAQ run or
replay is active.

For details about data extraction refer to :ref:`analysis-sources`.
Descriptions of available operators can be found in :ref:`analysis-operators`.
For details about 1D and 2D histograms check the :ref:`analysis-sinks` section.

.. _analysis-working-with-histos:

Working with histograms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1D and 2D histograms are shown in the bottom row of the user interface. Raw 1D
histograms are grouped by module in the bottom-left *L0 Raw Data Display* area.
Higher level data displays are grouped by histogram type.

New histograms can be added by right-clicking in one of the data display areas,
selecting *New* and choosing the histogram type.

.. _analysis-working-with-1d-histos:

1D
^^

1D histograms can take full arrays as input parameters. Internally an array of
histograms of the same size as the input array will be created.

Double-click on the *H1D* node to open the histogram array widget:

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_histo1d_listwidget.png

    1D Histogram Array Widget

* The histogram index can be changed using the spinbox in the top-right corner.

* Zooming is achieved by dragging a rectangle using the left mouse button. Zoom
  levels are stacked. Click the right mouse button to zoom out one level.

* Press the *Info* button to enable an info display at the bottom-right of the window.
  This will show the current cursor coordinates and the corresponding bin number.

* Y-Scale

  Toggle between linear and logarithmic scales for the Y-Axis.

* Gauss

  Fit a gauss curve through the currently visible maximum value.

* Rate Est.

  Rate Estimation feature.

  Refer to :ref:`howto-rate-estimation` for a how-to guide.

* Clear

  Clears the current histogram.

* Export

  Allows exporting to PDF and various image formats. Use the file type
  selection in the file dialog to choose the export format.

* Save

  Saves the histogram data to a flat text file.

* Subrange

  Allows limiting the range of data that's accumulated. Only input values
  falling within the specified interval will be accumulated.

  This does not affect the histogram resolution: the full range of bins is
  still used with the limits given by the subrange.

* Resolution

  Change the resolution of the histogram in powers of two from 1 bit to 20 bits.

  This will not rebin existing data. Instead the histogram is cleared
  and new data is accumulated using the newly set resolution.

.. _analysis-working-with-1d-histos-calibration:

* Calibration

  This button is enabled if the histograms input is a :ref:`Calibration
  Operator <analysis-Calibration>` and allows to directly modify the
  calibration information from within the histogram:

    .. autofigure:: images/analysis_histo1d_adjust_calibration.png
        :scale-latex: 60%

        Calibration adjustment from within the histogram display

  The two inputs in the *Actual* column refer to the current x-axis scale. The
  inputs in the *Target* column are used to specify the desired x-axis values.

  Click on one of the *Actual* inputs and then press the *Vis. Max* button to
  fill in the x-coordinate of the currently visible maximum value. Then enter the
  new x-coordinate value in the *Target* box and press *Apply*.

  In the example above it is known that the peak should be at ``x = 600.0``. The
  current x-coordinate of the peak was found using the *Vis. Max* button.
  Pressing *Apply* will modify the calibration for that particular histogram.

  To see a list of calibration values for each channel open the Analysis UI
  (``Ctrl+2``), right-click the :ref:`Calibration Operator
  <analysis-Calibration>` and select *Edit*.

* 2D combined view

  A combined view of the histograms of an array of parameters can be opened by
  right-clicking a **H1D** node and selecting *Open 2D Combined View*. This
  option will open a 2D histogram with one column per 1D histogram in the
  array.

  The X-axes of the 1D histograms are plotted on the combined views Y-axis, the
  values of the histograms are plotted in Z.

  This view allows to quickly see if any or all channels of a module are
  responding.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_histo1d_combined_view.png

    2D Combined View of MDPP-16_SCP amplitude values

    Channels 0 and 8 are producing data with visible peaks at around 0 and 230.


.. _analysis-working-with-2d-histos:

2D
^^

2D histograms take two single values as their inputs: the X and Y parameters to
accumulate. When selecting the inputs you will need to expand other operators
and select the desired index directly.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_ui_add_histo2d.png
    :scale-latex: 80

    Adding a 2D Histogram

    Expand operator outputs and select individual indices for both axes.

Optional range limits can be specified for the axes. If enabled only values
falling within the given interval will be accumulated.

Double-click on a *H2D* node to open the histogram widget:

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_histo2d_widget.png

    2D Histogram Widget

* Zooming is achieved by dragging a rectangle using the left mouse button. Zoom
  levels are stacked. Click the right mouse button to zoom out one level.

* Press the *Info* button to show histo and cursor coordinate information at
  the bottom of the window.

* Z-Scale

  Toggle between linear and logarithmic scales for the Z-Axis.

* X- and Y-Proj

  Create the X/Y-Projection and open it in a new 1D histogram window. The
  projection will follow any zooming/scrolling done in the 2D histogram.

* Clear

  Clears the histogram.

* Export

  Allows exporting to PDF and various image formats. Use the file type
  selection in the file dialog to choose the export format.

* Subrange

  Allows limiting the range of data that's accumulated. Only input values
  falling within the specified interval will be accumulated.

  This does not affect the histogram resolution: the full range of bins is
  still used with the limits given by the subrange.

  Can optionally create a new histogram with the specified limits instead of
  modifying the current one. The newly created histogram will be added to the
  analysis.

* Resolution

  Change the resolution of the histograms axes in powers of two from 1 bit to 13 bits.

  This will not rebin existing data. Instead the histogram is cleared
  and new data is accumulated using the newly set resolution.

System Details
----------------------------------------

As outlined in the :ref:`introduction <intro-analysis>` the analysis system is
a set of interconnected objects with data flowing from :ref:`Sources
<analysis-sources>` through :ref:`Operators <analysis-operators>` into
:ref:`Sinks <analysis-sinks>`.

The system is structured the same way as the VME Configuration: VME modules are
grouped into events. An event contains the modules that are read out on
activation of a certain trigger condition. The result of the readout is the
modules event data (basically an array of 32-bit words). This module event data
is the input to the analysis system.

When processing data from a live DAQ run or from a listfile replay the analysis
system is "stepped" in terms of events: in each step all the
:ref:`analysis-sources` attached to a module get passed the modules event data.
The task of each source is to extract relevant values from its input data and
make these values available to subsequent operators and sinks.

.. FIXME: What is the correct order?

After all sources have processed the module event data, the dependent operators
and sinks are stepped in the correct order. Each object consumes its input and
generates new output or in the case of sinks accumulates incoming data into a
histogram.

.. figure:: images/analysis_flowchart.png

    Example analysis dataflow

Parameter Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The transport container carrying data between objects is the Parameter Array:

+-----------------+------------+-------+--------+
| **Parameter Array**                           |
+=================+============+=======+========+
| size            | unit label                  |
+-----------------+------------+-------+--------+
| **Parameters**                                |
+-----------------+------------+-------+--------+
| 0               | value      | valid | limits |
+-----------------+------------+-------+--------+
| 1               | value      | valid | limits |
+-----------------+------------+-------+--------+
| 2               | value      | valid | limits |
+-----------------+------------+-------+--------+
| \.\.\.          |            |       |        |
+-----------------+------------+-------+--------+
| *size-1*        | value      | valid | limits |
+-----------------+------------+-------+--------+

The *size* of parameter arrays is determined at analysis startup time and is
constant throughout the run. The *unit label* is a string which currently can
be set through the use of the :ref:`Calibration Operator
<analysis-Calibration>`. The index of a parameter in the array is usually the
channel address that was extracted from the modules data.

Each parameter has the following attributes:

* *value* (double)

  The parameters data value.

* *valid* (bool)

  True if the parameter is considered valid, false otherwise.

  A parameter can become invalid if for example a data source did not extract a
  value for the corresponding channel address or an operator wants to
  explicitly filter out the address or could not calculate a valid result for
  the input value.

* *limits* (two doubles)

  Two double values forming the interval ``[lowerLimit, upperLimit)`` that the
  parameters value should fall into. This is used by histogram sinks and
  calibration operators to determine the parameters range and thus calculate
  the binning.

Connection types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different operators have different requirements on their input types. The
:ref:`Calibration Operator <analysis-Calibration>` for example can use whole
parameter arrays as its input, transforms each data value and produces an
output array of the same size as the input size.

Other operators can only act on individual values and thus connect directly to
a specific *index* into the parameter array. An example is the :ref:`2D
Histogram Sink <analysis-histo2dsink>`: it requires exactly two input values, X
and Y, neither of which can be an array.

.. figure:: images/analysis_input_types.png

   Example of different input types

Each Operator implementation decides which types of input connections it
accepts. Some operators even change the type of inputs they accept based on the
first input type that is connected (they either accept full arrays for all
their inputs or single values for all their inputs).

The :ref:`Analysis UI <analysis-ui>` will highlight valid input nodes in green
when selecting an operators input.

.. _analysis-sources:

Data Sources
----------------------------------------
Analysis Data Sources attach directly to a VME module. On every step of the
analysis system they're handed all the data words produced by that module in
the corresponding readout cycle. Their job is to extract data values from the
raw module data and produce an output parameter array. Currently there's one
Source implemented: The :ref:`Filter Extractor <analysis-extractor>`

.. _analysis-extractor:

Filter Extractor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Filter Extractor uses a list of bit-level filters to classify input words
and extract address and data values.

Filter Basics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A single filter consists of 32 characters used to match a 32-bit data word. The
filter describes the static parts of the data used for matching and the
variable parts used for data extraction. The first (leftmost) character of a
filter line matches bit 31, the last character bit 0.

The following characters are used in filter strings:

+-----------+---------------------+
| Character | Description         |
+===========+=====================+
| ``0``     | bit must be cleared |
+-----------+---------------------+
| ``1``     | bit must be set     |
+-----------+---------------------+
| ``A``     | address bit         |
+-----------+---------------------+
| ``D``     | data bit            |
+-----------+---------------------+
| others    | don't care          |
+-----------+---------------------+

The following conventions are used in the default filters that come with mvme:

* ``X`` is used if any bit value is allowed.
* ``O`` (the letter) is used to denote the position of the *overflow* bit.
* ``U`` is used to denote the position of the *underflow* bit.
* ``P`` is used to denote the position of the *pileup* bit.

These characters are merely used to make it easier to identify certain bits
when editing a filter. With regards to matching any character other than ``0``
or ``1`` means that any bit value is allowed.

.. highlight:: none

**Example**: The default *Amplitude* filter for the MDPP-16_SCP: ::

  0001 XXXX PO00 AAAA DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD

The filter above contains a 4-bit address and a 16-bit data value. The
positions of the pileup and overflow bits are marked using ``P`` and ``O``.
This helps when adjusting the filter to e.g. match only pileup data (replace
the ``P`` with a ``1``).

The number of address bits (``A``) determine the size of the Filter Extractors
output array.

Data extraction from an input data word is done by keeping only the bits
matching the address or data mask and then right shifting to align with the 0
bit.

.. note::
   Address and data bit masks do not need to be consecutive. ``A0AA`` will
   produce 3-bit address values by gathering all extracted ``A`` bits on the
   right: ``0AAA``.

Each filter has an optional *word index* attached to it. If the word index is
set to a value >= 0, then the filter can only produce a match on the module
data word with the same index.

Multiple filter words
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Filter Extractor implementation allows combining multiple 32-bit filters to
match and extract data from multiple input words.

Filters are tried in order. If a previously unmatched filter produces a match
no further filters will be tried for the same data word.

Once all individual filters have been matched the whole combined filter matches
and address and data values can be extracted.

When extracting values the filters are again used in order: the first filter
produces the lowest bits of the combined result, the result of the next filter
is left-shifted by the amount of bits in the previous filter and so on.

.. note::
   The maximum number of bits that can be extracted for address and data values
   is limited to 64.

See :ref:`howto-rate-estimation-ts-extraction` for an example of how a
multiword filter can be used.

Matching and data extraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During a DAQ run or a replay the Filter Extractor gets passed all the data that
was produced by a single module readout (*Event Data*). Each data word is
passed to the internal filter.

Once the filter has completed *Required Completion Count* times address and
data values will be extracted.

The data value is cast to a double and a uniform random value in the range
``[0, 1)`` is added. This resulting value is stored in the output parameter
array at the index specified by the extracted address value.

User Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the Analysis UI right-click a Module and select *New -> Filter Extractor* to
add a new filter.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_add_filter_extractor.png
    :scale-latex: 60%

    Filter Extractor UI

Use the *+* and *-* symbols to add/remove filter words. The spinbox right of
the filter string lets you specify a word index for the corresponding filter.

*Required Completion Count* allows you to specify how many times the filter has
to match before it produces data. This completion count starts from 0 on every
module event and is incremented by one each time the complete filter matches.

If *Generate Histograms* is checked raw and calibrated histograms will be
created for the filter. *Unit Label*, *Unit Min* and *Unit Max* are parameters
for the :ref:`Calibration Operator <analysis-Calibration>`.

Predefined filters can be loaded into the UI using the *Load Filter Template*
button.


.. _analysis-operators:

Operators
----------------------------------------

mvme currently implements the following operators:


.. _analysis-Calibration:

Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The calibration operator allows to add a unit label to a parameter array and to
calibrate input parameters using *unitMin* and *unitMax* values.

Each input parameters ``[lowerLimit, upperLimit)`` interval is mapped to the
outputs ``[unitMin, unitMax)`` interval.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_Calibration.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

With *calibrate()*: ::

  Out = (In - lowerLimit) * (unitMax - unitMin) / (upperLimit - lowerLimit) + unitMin

Limits can be specified individually for each address in the input array. Use
the *Apply* button to set all addresses to the global min and max values.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_calibration_ui.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

    Calibration UI

.. note::
    Calibration information can also be accessed from adjacent 1D histograms.
    Refer to :ref:`Working with 1D Histograms
    <analysis-working-with-1d-histos-calibration>` for details.


.. _analysis-IndexSelector:

Index Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select a specific index from the input array and copy it to the output.

This operator produces an output array of size 1.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_IndexSelector.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

.. _analysis-PreviousValue:

Previous Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Outputs the input array from the previous event. Optionally outputs the last
input that was valid.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_PreviousValue.png
    :scale-latex: 80%


.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_PreviousValue_explanation.png

    Behaviour of Previous Value over time.

If *keepValid* is set the output will always contain the last valid input
values.

This operator can be combined with the :ref:`Difference Operator
<analysis-Difference>` to accumulate the changes of a parameter across events.
See :ref:`howto-rate-estimation` for an example.

.. _analysis-Difference:

Difference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Produces the element-wise difference of its two inputs *A* and *B*:

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_Difference.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

The output unit label is taken from input *A*. If ``A[i]`` or ``B[i]`` are
invalid then ``Out[i]`` will be set to invalid: ::

    Out.Unit = A.Unit
    Out[i].lowerLimit = A[i].lowerLimit - B[i].upperLimit
    Out[i].upperLimit = A[i].upperLimit - B[i].lowerLimit
    Out[i].value      = A[i].value - B[i].value

.. _analysis-Sum:

Sum / Mean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculates the sum (optionally the mean) of the elements of its input array.

This operator produces an output array of size 1.


.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_Sum.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

When calculating the mean the number of *valid* input values is used as the denominator.

.. _analysis-ArrayMap:

Array Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows selecting and reordering arbitrary indices from a variable number of
input arrays.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_ArrayMap.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

The mappings are created via the user interface:

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_array_map.png
    :scale-latex: 60%

    Array Map UI

* Use the *+* and *-* buttons to add/remove inputs. The elements of newly added
  inputs will show up in the left *Input* list.
* Select elements in the *Input* and *Output* lists and use the arrow buttons
  to move them from one side to the other.

Multiple items can be selected by control-clicking, ranges of items by
shift-clicking. Both methods can be combined to select ranges with holes
in-between them. Focus a list and press ``Ctrl-A`` to select all items.

.. _analysis-RangeFilter1D:

1D Range Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_RangeFilter1D.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

Keeps values if they fall inside (optionally outside) a given interval. Input
values that do not match the criteria are set to *invalid* in the output.

.. _analysis-RectFilter2D:

2D Rectangle Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_RectFilter2D.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

Produces a single *valid* output value if both inputs satisfy an interval based
condition.

.. _analysis-ConditionFilter:

Condition Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_op_ConditionFilter.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

Copies data input to output if the corresponding element of the condition input
is valid.

.. _analysis-sinks:

Data Sinks (Histograms / Data Export)
----------------------------------------

mvme currently implements the following data sinks:

.. _analysis-histo1dsink:

1D Histogram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Accumulates incoming data into 1D histograms. Accepts a full array or an
individual value as input. If given a full array the number of histograms that
will be created is equal to the array size.

See :ref:`Working with 1D histograms <analysis-working-with-1d-histos>` for usage details.

.. _analysis-histo2dsink:

2D Histogram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Accumulates two incoming parameters into a 2D histogram. On each event input
data will only be accumulated if both the X- and Y inputs are *valid*.

See :ref:`Working with 2D histograms <analysis-working-with-2d-histos>` for details.

.. _analysis-exportsink:

Export Sink
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_export_sink_ui.png
    :scale-latex: 80%

Implements data export to binary files and C++/Python example code generation.

The Export Sink has a variable number of data input arrays that will be written
to disk. Additionally a single value condition input can be used to pre-filter
data: output data will only be generated if the condition input is *valid*.


Loading an Analysis / Importing Objects
---------------------------------------

Internally VME modules are uniquely identified by a UUID and the module type
name. This information is stored in both the VME and analysis configs.

When opening (or importing from) a "foreign" analysis file, module UUIDs and
types may not match. In this case auto-assignment of analysis objects to VME
modules is tried first. If auto-assignment is not possible the "Module
assignment" dialog will be shown.

.. autofigure:: images/analysis_import_ui.png
    :scale-latex: 100%

    Module assignment dialog

Each row contains one module present in the analysis that's being
opened/imported. The columns contain the modules present in the local VME
configuration.

Use the radio buttons to assign analysis objects to VME modules. Select
*discard* to completely remove the corresponding module from the analysis.

If the dialog is accepted the source objects UUIDs will be rewritten to match
the VME object ids.

In addition to opening an analysis file and thus replacing the current analysis
objects, it is possible to add objects to the current analysis. Use the
*Import* action fronm the Analysis UI toolbar to import from another file.

Directly importing for a specific module is possible by right-clicking the
module in the Analysis UI and selecting *Import*. Only objects matching the
selected module type will be imported from the selected analysis.

Newly imported operators will be placed in a new User Level in the UI. Use drag
and drop to reorder them as needed.
