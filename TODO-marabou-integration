* Add crate ID to mvme stream format
  new listfile format v3:

  - Section Type ID: upper 3 bits -> 8 section types, 5 used with the new
    pause/resume section type

    33222222222211111111110000000000
    10987654321098765432109876543210
   +--------------------------------+
   |ttt                             |
   +--------------------------------+

  - Event Section Header:

    33222222222211111111110000000000
    10987654321098765432109876543210
   +--------------------------------+
   |001ccceeee  ssssssssssssssssssss|
   +--------------------------------+

   3 bit type as above
   3 bit crate index -> 8 crates possible
   4 bit event index -> 16 events/triggers possible
   2 spare bits
   20 bit size in 32-bit words

   This adds the new crate index and moves the event index right by 3 bits.
   This way crate index + event index form increasing addresses if interpreted
   as a single number.

* Implement robust child process starting and management

* Design information passing interface between mvme and child processes
  Just use the damn listfile format already! This first streams the config in
  chunks containing json data. Then the readout data follows with minimal
  additional information. This is what we want!

  Missing information: run name, start time, (directories and paths maybe)
