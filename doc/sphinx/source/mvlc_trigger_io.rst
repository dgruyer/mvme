MVLC Trigger I/O Module
==================================================

Introduction
------------
The MVLC VME controller contains a digitial logic module enabling flexible
configuration of readout trigger logic and timings. The module includes setup
of the front-panel NIM IOs and ECL outputs, internal logic functions, signal
routing and access to utilities like timers, counters and the VME system clock.

The low-level setup of the Trigger I/O module is performed by writing to
special registers via MVLCs internal VME interface at base address
``0xffff0000``.  This means standard VME write commands can be used to setup
the module, create software triggers and read out counter values.

mvme contains a dedicated graphical interface representing the structure and
internal connections of the logic module. This interface shields the user from
the low-level details, allows to use custom signal names and simplifies
creating complex setups. The low-level VME commands used to setup the logic
module can still be viewed and manually edited if needed.

Structure and execution
-----------------------

   Structure of the MVLC Trigger I/O module

Logically the MVLC Trigger I/O module is divided into 4 levels with signals
originating on the lowest level and flowing through the system towards the
higher levels.

Each of the levels contains a set of specific units representing functionality
provided by the logic module. This includes the NIM I/Os, timers, lookup
tables, counters, access to command stacks etc.

The units from higher levels connect back to units from lower levels. Some of
these connections are hardwired while others can be dynamically selected from a
set of options.

Level 0 contains signal-generating units like NIM inputs, the VME system clock
and timers.

Levels 1 and 2 contain lookup tables which can be used to implement arbitrary
boolean logic and route signals to higher levels.

Level 3 consists of signal-consuming units like NIM outputs, counters and
units for executing command stacks.

.. TODO: add information about internal clocking and processing (maybe)
.. TODO: figure out internal timings and add more about how stuff works. maybe
.. TODO: also mention strobes and latches.
.. The system interally runs at a fixed clock rate. Signal state changes thus
.. happen at discrete time intervals.

User Interface and integration into mvme
----------------------------------------

Inside mvme the MVLC Trigger I/O module will appear as the topmost item in the
VME Config tree when one of the MVLC variants (USB or Ethernet) is selected as
the VME Controller.

.. autofigure:: images/intro_vme_tree01.png

Double-clicking this module will open a dedicated GUI representing the current
configuration of the logic module. The view can be zoomed via the mouse wheel
and panned by holding down the left mouse button and moving the cursor.

Each of the blocks can be double-clicked to open an editor window specific to
the unit or groups of units. Input and output pins are represented by small
circles near the edges of each block. Connection between pins are drawn as
arrows from source to destination.

The user interface only draws arrows for connections it considers *active*.
NIM and ECL units have their own activation flags present in the hardware while
other units such as timers - which interally are always active - have a
software-only activation flag. Lookup table inputs are only considered active
if the corresponding input is actually used in the logic function implemented
by the LUT.

Each of the specific editor windows allows editing the names of input/output
pins which makes routing and connecting signals easier.

By default changes made in any of the editor windows are applied immediately
upon closing the editor or pressing the ``Apply`` button as long as mvme is
connected to an MVLC. This means the software representation of the Trigger I/O
module is converted to a list of VME write commands targeting the MVLC and then
this list is directly executed. Use the ``Autorun`` button from the top toolbar
to toggle this behaviour.

If you want to view or edit the VME write commands directly use the ``View
Script`` button, make your changes inside the text editor that opens up and
then press the ``Reparse from script`` button to update the user interface.

Descriptions of the available units and their corresponding GUI editors can be
found in :ref:`the next section <mvlc_trigger_io_units>`.

When starting a new DAQ run the initialization procedure will apply the current
logic setup to the MVLC before further initializing any modules and setting up
the readout stacks.

Reserved logic units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To implement events that should be periodcally read out mvme reserves the first
two timer and stack start units. Currently these units are not available for
modification in the user interface.

Whenever a periodic event is created the first available timer unit is setup
with the events readout period. The first available StackStart unit is then
connected to the timer and setup to start the events readout command stack.

Note that if more than two periodic VME events are created, the rest of the
Timer and StackStart units will also be used by mvme. Having more than 4
periodic events defined in the VME config is not allowed and will lead to an
error at startup.

I/O and logic units
-------------------

NIM I/Os
~~~~~~~~
The front panel NIM connectors can be configured as either input or output.
This means they are available both on the level0 input side and on the level3
output side.

.. TODO: minmax values and units everywhere.

Settings
^^^^^^^^
* Delay
* Width
* Holdoff
* Invert

   Inverts the signal. If the NIM is used as an output it will be
   permanently active while its input is *false*.

.. TODO: what does invert do when the NIM is an input?

ECL outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~
These are similar to the NIM output units. Each of the 3 outputs needs to be
activated separately.

Timers
~~~~~~
Generate logic pulses with a set frequency.

.. TODO: minmax values
.. TODO: explain how to reset them


Settings
^^^^^^^^
* Range

  The time unit the timer period refers to. One of *ns*, *Âµs*, *ms* or *s*.

* Period

  The period in units specified by Range.

  Minimum: 8 ns, maximum: 65535 s.

IRQ Units
~~~~~~~~~
Generates a signal when one of the 7 available VME IRQs triggers. The only
setting is the IRQ number (1-7) this unit should react to.

Soft Triggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Software triggers which can be permanently activated via the GUI or by
executing one of the folowing VME Scripts:

::

   setbase 0xffff0000		# use the mvlc vme interface as the base address
   0x0200 0x0006          	# select soft_trigger0 (Level0.Unit6)
   0x0300 1                	# activate the trigger

::

   setbase 0xffff0000		# use the mvlc vme interface as the base address
   0x0200 0x0007          	# select soft_trigger1 (Level0.Unit7)
   0x0300 1                	# activate the trigger

To use the above scripts in mvme right-click the ``Manual`` section in the VME
Config area and choose ``Add Script``, type a name and double-click the newly
created script to edit it. Then paste the script text into the editor and use
the ``Run Script`` button to execute it.

Slave Triggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Activates when one of the slave triggers fires. This feature will be available
in the future with a special multi-crate firmware and supporting software.

Stack Busy
~~~~~~~~~~
The stack busy units are active while their corresponding VME command stack is
being executed.

In the mvme user interface the command stack numbers are augmented with the
event names defined in the VME config.

Sysclk
~~~~~~
This unit provides access to the 16 MHz VMEbus system clock.

Lookup Tables (Levels 1 and 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The MVLC contains a set of lookup tables useful for creating logic functions
and signal routing. Each lookup table (LUT) maps 6 input bits to 3 output bits.
This allows to implement 3 functions each mapping 6 input bits to one output
bit or a single 6 to 3 bit function.

The first three LUTs on Level1 are hardwired to the NIM inputs. There is some
overlap as 14 NIM inputs are connected to the 3*6=18 inputs of the first three
LUTs.

The LUTs on level2 connect back to the level1 LUTs and each has 3 variable
inputs which can be connected to the level1 utility units or certain level1 LUT
outputs. Additionally the level2 LUTs each have a strobe input which is used to
synchronize the switching of the LUT outputs.

LUT Editor GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Editing of the LUT function is done via its own GUI:

.. autofigure:: images/mvlc_trigger_io_lut_editor.png
   :scale-latex: 60%

   Editor window for a LUT on Level2.

Elements from top to bottom:

* Dynamic input selection for the first three inputs.

  This only appears for LUTs on Level2. The drop down boxes are populated with
  the possible choices for each of the dynamic inputs.

* Three columns of LUT functions, one for each of the three LUT output signals.

  Each LUT maps 6 input bits to 3 output bits. This means a total of
  :math:`2^{6}=64` input combinations per LUT. To make editing easier only the
  combinations for selected input bits are shown.

  Select the inputs you want to use via the checkboxes under ``Input Bit
  Usage``. This will populate the ``Output Activation`` table with the correct
  number of rows to represent each possible input combination.

  Each row of the ``Output Activation`` table represents the state of the
  output for the corresponding input combination. The input bit combination is
  shown on each row header with the lowest bit taking the rightmost place.
  Click the button to toggle the output state for the corresponding input
  combination.

  Using the ``AND``, ``OR`` and ``INVERT`` buttons allows quickly populate the
  table with the corresponding function or invert the current assignment.

* For Level2 LUTs only: strobe input selection and parameters.

  For Level2 LUTs an additional ``Strobe Output`` checkbox is visible below the
  function table. If set the corresponding output bit will be affected by the
  LUTs strobe input.

  The strobe input can be selected from a predefined list and its parameters
  can be set using the controls in ``Strobe Gate Generate Settings``.

Note: mvme will attempt to minimize the boolean functions defined by each of
the LUTs. This means that not all selected input bits will necessarily be
selected again when next opening the editor window but the resulting function
should be identical.

Example
^^^^^^^
.. autofigure:: images/mvlc_trigger_io_lut_example.png
   :scale-latex: 60%

   Example LUT using input bits 0, 2 and 4. The output is activated if exactly
   two of the inputs are set.

StackStart
~~~~~~~~~~
These units start the execution of one of the 7 MVLC command stacks.

Settings
^^^^^^^^
* Number of the command stack to execute
* Activation flag

In the mvme user interface the command stack numbers are augmented with the
event names defined in the VME config.

MasterTrigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generates a master trigger in multi-crate setups. This feature will be
available in the future with a special multi-crate firmware and supporting
software.

Counters
~~~~~~~~
8 64-bit counter units incrementing by one each time the input rises. Each
counter has an optional latch input which atomically transfers the current
counter values to the counter registers. The latch can either be activated by
the Trigger/IO module or by writing to a special latch register.

The counter units can be read out via MVCLs internal VME interface at base
address ``0xffff0000`` using the following VME script:

::

   setbase 0xffff0000

   # counter0
   0x0200 0x0308           # counter select
   0x030a 1                # latch the counter (only needed if not done in the trigger_io module)
   read a32 d16 0x0300     # counter readout
   read a32 d16 0x0302
   read a32 d16 0x0304
   read a32 d16 0x0306

   # counter1
   /*
   0x0200 0x0309           # counter select
   0x030a 1                # latch the counter (only needed if not done in the trigger_io module)
   read a32 d16 0x0300     # counter readout
   read a32 d16 0x0302
   read a32 d16 0x0304
   read a32 d16 0x0306
   */

A dedicated VME module called ``MVLC Timestamp/Counter`` is provided by mvme to
ease setting up a counter readout. Add an instance of this module to the VME
Event where you want to read out the counter, edit the readout script (under
``Readout Loop`` in the user interface) and comment out all the counter blocks
except for the one that should be read out.

Examples
--------

* NIM input to stack start/counter + counter readout
* Timer/sysclk to counter + counter readout
* Timer to stackstart for periodic events
* SoftTrigger to NIM output
* Some LUT setups
