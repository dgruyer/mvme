To be able to use the Wiener VM-USB VME Controller libusb-win32 needs to be installed on the system and registered as a driver for the VM-USB. The Zadig USB Driver Installer is bundled with mvme and can optionally be launched to handle the driver installation.

In Zadig the correct driver (libusb-win32) will already be selected and a connected VM-USB should appear in the device selection (as "VM-USB VME Crate Controller"). Pressing "Install Driver" will start the driver installation.
