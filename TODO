==== Do these first! =====
* BUGS: generating default filters when clicking on module nodes does not always work!!!!



* Histogram properties:
    - name
    - size in bits
    - value/ channel
    - unit (Text: "ps") // Histogram may show at 64k: "24 ps/chan" or at 8k res: "192 ps/chan"
    - zero point        (chan 2048 is zero, left negative, right positive)



==== Do these later! =====
* threading and vme commands
  * run vme scripts in a separate thread when invoked from the gui
  * FIX the pause, run script, resume implementation. it's buggy and hacky!
    - run script: Maybe implement a command queue in the context and return
                  QFuture<VMEResultList> objects to clients.
    - pause and resume: also return a QFuture or something to be able to wait for
                        the state change
    -> look at QFutureInterface

* fix Hist2D source definitions
* HistogramCollection improvements: subsections for amplitude, time, trigger time, etc
    => see data filter specification below
* TwoDimWidget: use QwtPlotHistogram instead of QwtPlotCurve
* add histogram filters
* add histogram fitting
* add log scale to 2d histograms (?)
* vmusb & mvme buffer debugging
* workspace concept
    - workspace directory
    - subdirectory for listfiles
    - subdirectory for vme-scripts
    - daqconfig.json
    - analysis.json

* make use of the "enabled" flag for vme scripts, modules, events, etc
* ReadoutWorker split into generic and controller specific parts:
    Generic part is responsible for:
        - running vme init scripts
        - creating and opening the output listfile

    Controller specific parts:
        - init
        - readout
        - shutdown
        - pause
        - resume

* save and restore the position and size of windows
* save and restore the zoom and pan of histograms
* save and restore open histograms
* histograms: look at the storage type used. currently it's u32. should this be double?

==== Maybe do these ====
* Move from MDI to multiple top-level windows (allows making use of multiple monitors)

==== Done, but kept for reference ====
* module data filter specifications:
  P=pileup, O=overflow, U=underflow (add these as special histogram channels?)
  Histograms: array[A][D]++

  - MDPP (initialized to 16-bit output)
    * 16 amplitude values
      0001 XXXX PO00 AAAA DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD

    * 16 time values
      0001 XXXX XX01 AAAA DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD

    * 2 trigger time values
      0001 XXXX XX10 000A DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD

    - MADC (initialized to 13-bit output, independent of resolution)
    * 32 amplitude values
      00XX X1XX 000A AAAA 0O0D DDDD DDDD DDDD

  P, O, U are just there for convenience and should be set to 0/1/X by the user
  -> "amplitudes with overflow", "amplitudes without overflow", "amplitudes with and without overflow"
     are possible

  Requirements:
    * fast filtering in MVMEEventProcessor
    * 2d histo source selection should reference filter + address
    * fast filling of 2d histos
