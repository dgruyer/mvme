Notes for a onboard Realtek 8168 adapter under Windows 10:
  For my onboard Realtek 8168 I had to download a driver update directly from
  Realtek because the driver shipped with Windows 10 does not support setting
  the MTU. After the driver update open 'Control Panel -> Network and Sharing
  Center -> Change Adapter Settings', right-click your adapter, select
  'Properties', 'Configure' and then 'Advanced'. In the list select 'Jumbo
  Frames' and set it to '9KB MTU'.

  After this I was able to receive jumbo frames correctly. I did not have to
  change the MTU settings using the 'netsh' commands shown below.


Show network interfaces and their MTU:

    netsh interface ipv4 show interfaces

Set the MTU of a specific network interface (in this case the one with
index14. Instead of an index the name of the interface can also be used.

    netsh interface ipv4 set subinterface "14" mtu=9000 store=persistent
