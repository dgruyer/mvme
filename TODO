* Limit the number of messages/s appended to the logview
* How to handle filters without matching module? Right now they're not
  displayed until a module with the corresponding (eventIndex,moduleIndex) is
  created.
  Related: Remove Hist2d on filter removal?


* add versioning to the GUI state saved via QSettings. If the version changes
  use the default layout instead of restoring a possibly incompatible state.
* add ability to create 2d histograms during DAQ/replay and fill them immediately

* Histos
  * mousewheel zoom does not add scrollbars to the plot!
  * left click in 1d histo shows wrong y-values
  * Hist1DWidget:
    - don't zoom into negative x
    - fix mousewheel zoom or disable it
    - display coordinate and value under mouse cursor
    - displayed zoomrect coordinate values are sometimes bogus
  
  * Hist2DWidget:

  * add histogram cuts
  * add histogram fitting
  * Hist1D:
    - axis titles do not contain slashes as (filter/address) separators


* Histogram properties:
    - name
    - size in bits
    - value/ channel
    - unit (Text: "ps") // Histogram may show at 64k: "24 ps/chan" or at 8k res: "192 ps/chan"
    - zero point        (chan 2048 is zero, left negative, right positive)

* threading and vme commands
  * run vme scripts in a separate thread when invoked from the gui
  * FIX the pause, run script, resume implementation. it's buggy and hacky!
    - run script: Maybe implement a command queue in the context and return
                  QFuture<VMEResultList> objects to clients.
    - pause and resume: also return a QFuture or something to be able to wait for
                        the state change
    -> look at QFutureInterface

* vmusb & mvme buffer debugging
* workspace concept
    - workspace directory
    - subdirectory for listfiles
    - daqconfig.json
    - analysis.json

* prefix and run number for listfiles
* display generated listfile name when daq runs
* don't write listfile on "1 cycle"

* ReadoutWorker split into generic and controller specific parts:
    Generic part is responsible for:
        - running vme init scripts
        - creating and opening the output listfile

    Controller specific parts:
        - init
        - readout
        - shutdown
        - pause
        - resume
  Do this when implementing support for another controller

* save and restore the position and size of windows
* save and restore the zoom and pan of histograms
* save and restore open histograms
* histograms: look at the storage type used. currently it's u32. should this be double?
* make use of the "enabled" flag for vme scripts, modules, events, etc

==========================
===== Maybe do these =====
==========================
* Move from MDI to multiple top-level windows (allows making use of multiple monitors)
