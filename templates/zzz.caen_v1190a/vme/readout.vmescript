# (M)BLT readout until BERR.
# When using MBLT to read out the V1190A the 32-bit words in each transferred
# 64-bit word are swapped compared to the order the mesytec modules yield the
# data.
# When using the mesytec MVLC the new 'mblts' command can be used to perform
# the readout and swap. With other controllers the standard 'bltfifo' command
# should be used.

mblts a32 0x0000 0xffff         # MBLT swapped (MVLC only)
#bltfifo a32 0x0000 0xffff      # BLT for other controllers
