* Build a periodic CmdPipe reader using QTimer and QtConcurrent::run.
  Test this with a small timeout and using the MVLCDialog in parallel. The periodic reader
  should never receive any of the dialog data.
  FIXME: the locking as it is done right now does not protect against the periodic reader
  jumping in between action the dialog code performs. The dialog operations are not atomic
  at all....

* Build a tool to verify incoming readout data. Check headers and pointers. Test this with
  different incoming event sizes.
  For the first pass it's ok to do this offline.

* Refactor VMEConfigTreeWidget to not depend on MVMEContext anymore.


* add a vme script command for the WriteSpecial stack command
* test the Marker stack command

* Low Level MVLC Ethernet Debugging:

    ifconfig enp2s0 192.168.42.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    arp -i enp2s0 -s 192.168.42.2 0a:0f:0f:0e:12:34

  Start wireshark or tcpdump in a second terminal window
    sudo tcpdump -i enp2s0 -vvXX

  Use netcat to generate an UDP packet containing "Hello, World!" as the payload.
    echo "Hello, world!" | netcat -u 192.168.42.2 9000

  To delete the arp entry:
    arp -i enp2s0 -d 192.168.42.2
