Marabou <-> mvme integration
===============================================================================

Project motivation and goals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current PPC/MBS based readout is rather slow and complex compared to using
modern FPGA based VME controllers. A main reason for this is that a realtime
operating system running on the PPCs has to handle all VME communications in
software.

Replacing the PPC with an FPGA based controller allows for much faster trigger
rates and higher data rates (factor 100 and more). Also the complexity of
having to generate, compile and run code for the PPC side is removed.

The main goal of this integration project is to use the mesytec 'mvme' software
with a modern VME controller for the readout side, while keeping as much of the
currently existing Marabou/ROOT based analysis code as possible.

To achieve the above goal a mvme -> Marabou analysis code generator program is
implemented. This program can be used to create the basic Marabou anaylsis code
template required to correctly interpret received readout data, map
channels/paramters to user defined names and call users custom analysis
functions.

Also a system to start subprocesses and pass raw readout data in mvme listfile
format to those subprocesses will be added to mvme. One such adapter subprocess
can then consume mvme readout data and produce Marabou compatible ROOT files or
supply input to a running M_analyze process.

This design with small processes doing the code generation and data adaptation
work was chosen to keep the coupling between mvme and the current Marabou/ROOT
versions to a minimum. When upgrading Marabou/ROOT only these adapter processes
will have to be recompiled instead of having to rebuild the whole mvme package.
