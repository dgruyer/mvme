* Is MultiWordDataFilter::handleDataWord() behaviour "correct"/"good"?
  Should it break out of the loop once a filter matched?
  -> This would make it so that at least n words of data are needed
     for an n-word filter. Right now, given the right subfilters the
     filter can complete with a single word of data.
  Should it skip matched filters when the next data word comes in?
  -> Right now the already extracted value for the filter will be
     overwritten.

* Rename DataFilter to ParameterExtractor

* Single word data filter matching and extraction must be very fast as they're
  used to handle most of the data and multi word filters are implemented in
  terms of single word filters.

* Filter on number of occurence: the filter is considered complete only if it
  matched N times.
  Needed for devices that can yield data for the same address in a single
  event. If the filter does not specify an occurence condition but matches
  multiple times only the first matched value will be kept.

  XXX: Impossible to simply accumulate all raw values for a channel into a Hist1D!

  -> Not an issue according to Robert as multi hits per channel need to be
     handled explicitly anyways.

* Address value extraction should be allowed for multi word data filters
