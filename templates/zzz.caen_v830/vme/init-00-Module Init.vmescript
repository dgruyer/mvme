## Parameters for Caen_V830 Latching Scaler

# Control Register
# Bit0: ACQ_Mode low
# Bit1: ACQ_Mode high
#       ACQ_Mode: 00 -> Trigger disabled
#                 01 -> Trigger random (external or from VME)
#                 10 -> Periodical Trigger
# Bit2: Data Format: 0 -> 32 bit, 1 -> 26 bit
# Bit3: Test Mode
# Bit4: BERR enable: if set BERR is generated when a block transfer
#       empties the module or a certain number of events has been
#       transferred.
# Bit5: Header Enable: if set the first data word sent via BLT is
#       a header word.
# Bit6: Clear MultiEventBuffer on CLEAR front panel signal (0: not cleared, 1: cleared)
# Bit7: Auto Reset: automatic counters reset after a trigger

# Note: some bits of the Control Register are set via variables to make them easier to change,
# others are fixed in the write command below.

# Specify both bits of the ACQ_Mode setting.
set acq_mode 01

# Switch between 26-bit and 32-bit data formats. The former contains the 5 bit channel address,
# a single identifier bit and 26-bits of counter value in each word. The latter format contains
# only the 32-bit counter values. This means when interpreting the data the channel number cannot be
# extracted but instead one has to rely on the position of the data word to determine the channel number.
set data_format 0

# Additional information for the mvme analysis side:
# The default analysis filters for the V830 are setup for data_format=0 and use
# position based ListFilters to extract the 32-bit counter value for each of the
# channels.
#
# When using data_format=1 the following extraction filters can be used:
# - XXXX X1XX XXXX XXXX DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD
#   Matches the header word and extracts the ascending 16 bit trigger sequence
#   number.
# - AAAA A0DD DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD
#   For the 32 channels with 26 data bits each.
#


# The test mode bit can be enabled when performing basic readout tests.
#   write a32 d32 0x1080 0xbeefdead
# can be used to set a 32-bit pattern to be put into each of the counters
# when the module receives a trigger.
#   write a32 d16 0x1124 1
# generates a VME/software trigger.
set test_mode 0

# Allows automatic counter reset after a trigger
set auto_reset 0

# Write Control Register
write a32 d16 0x1108 0b${auto_reset}011${test_mode}${data_format}${acq_mode}

# Channel Enable Register
# 32 bits, one to enable/disable each channel. Disabled channels are not
# included in the readout data. This has to be accounted for in the analysis
# when using 32-bit data format!
write a32 d32 0x1100 0xffffffff

# Interrupt Level Register
write a32 d16 0x1112 ${sys_irq}

# Interrupt Vector Register
write a32 d16 0x1114 0x00

# MCST/CBLT Address Register
write a32 d16 0x111c 0x${mesy_mcst}

# Almost Full Level Register
# Makes the module generate an Interrupt when at least this number of words is stored
# in the MultiEventBuffer.
# The V830 with 'header enable' set and all channels enabled yields 33 data words per event.
write a32 d16 0x112C $(${mesy_readout_num_events} * 33)

# BLT Event Number Register
# Number of complete events to be transferred via BLT.
write a32 d16 0x1130 ${mesy_readout_num_events}
