==================================================
VME configuration
==================================================

Structure
---------

The VME configuration in mvme models the logical VME setup. *Modules* that
should be read out as a result of the same trigger condition are grouped
together in an *Event*: ::

    Event0
        Module0.0
        Module0.1
        ...

    Event1
        Module1.0
        Module1.1
        ...

The type of available trigger conditions depends on the VME controller in use.
With the WIENER VM-USB the following triggers are available:

* NIM

  One external NIM input

* IRQ1-7

  The standard VME interrupts

* Periodic

  VM-USB supports one periodic trigger which is executed every ``n * 0.5s``
  (*Period*) or on every ``m-th`` data event (*Frequency*). If both values are
  set both internal counters are reset on each activation of the trigger. Refer
  to section 3.4.3 of the VM-USB manual for details.


Module and Event configuration
------------------------------

The module and event configuration is done using :ref:`VME scripts
<vme-script-reference>` which contain the commands necessary to initialize and
readout each module.

At the module level the following phases are defined:

* Reset

  Reset the module to a clean default state.

* Init

  Setup the module by writing specific registers.

* Readout

  The code needed to readout the module whenever the trigger condition fires.

The event level distinguishes between the following phases:

* Readout Cycle Start / End

  Inserted before / after the readout commands of the modules belonging to this
  event. The *Cycle Start* script is currently empty by default, the *Cycle
  End* script notifies the modules that readout has been performed. By default
  this is done by writing to the multicast address used for the event.

* DAQ Start / Stop

  Executed at the beginning / end of the a DAQ run. The purpose of the *DAQ
  Start* script is to reset module counters and tell each module to start data
  acquisition. *DAQ End* is used to tell the modules stop data acquisition. By
  default both scripts again use the multicast address of the corresponding
  event.

.. _vme-config-daq-start:

DAQ startup procedure
---------------------

* Reset and setup the VME controller
* Assemble readout code from configured Events

  For each Event do:

  * Add *Cycle Start* script
  * For each Module:

    * Add Module readout script
    * Add "Write EndMarker" command

  * Add *Cycle End* script

* Upload the readout code to the controller and activate triggers
* Execute global *DAQ Start* scripts
* Initialize Modules

  For each Event do:

    * For each Module do:

      * Run *Module Reset*
      * Run all *Module Init* scripts

    * Run the Events *Multicast DAQ Start* script

* Set the controller to autonomous DAQ mode

Control is handed to the VME controller. mvme is now reading and
interpreting data returned from the controller.

.. _vme-config-daq-stop:

DAQ stop procedure
------------------

* Tell the VME controller to leave autonomous DAQ mode
* Read leftover data from the VME controller
* Run the *DAQ Stop* script for each Event
* Execute global *DAQ Stop* scripts

VME Controller specifics
------------------------

SIS3153
~~~~~~~

If using the SIS3153 VME controller additional commands which activate Lemo
OUT2 during execution of the readout will be added to the script for the main
readout event. The main event is considered to be the first non-periodic event
defined in the VME configuration.

OUT1 and LED_A are activated prior to entering autonomous DAQ mode and
deactivated after leaving DAQ mode.
